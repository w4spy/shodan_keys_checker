# shodan_keys_checker
This script written in python3 for sorting and categorizing Shodan API keys that you can find via scraping the internet.
I wrote it because i kept finding keys all over the internet even paid though, 

this script breaks it down into "paid accounts" and "free accounts" after its done checking for validity of keys and u can save it to a file.

### Requirements
```sh
$ sudo pip3 install shodan
```

### usage 
```sh
$ python3 shodankeys -l keys.txt 
```
